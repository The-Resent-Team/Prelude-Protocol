cire3's implementation for protocol parsing and sending since TeaVM doesn't like Google's Protobuf.
For details see [technical-writeup.md](https://github.com/The-Resent-Team/Prelude-Protocol/technical-writeup.md)

Note: this jar is used on the client, so reflection and other similar techniques are not used.
